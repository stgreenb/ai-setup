Caliber analyzes your codebase — languages, frameworks, dependencies, architecture — and generates tailored, high-quality configs for **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, and **OpenAI Codex**. If configs already exist, it scores them, fixes what's stale, and keeps everything in sync as your code evolves.

```bash
npm install -g @rely-ai/caliber
caliber init
```

No API key required — works with your existing **Claude Code** or **Cursor** subscription. Or bring your own key (Anthropic, OpenAI, Vertex AI, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint).

## 💡 What Caliber Does

| Without Caliber | With Caliber |
|---|---|
| Hand-write CLAUDE.md, Cursor rules, AGENTS.md separately | One command generates all three, tuned to your actual codebase |
| Configs reference files that no longer exist | Deterministic scoring catches stale references and drift |
| New team members start with no AI context | `caliber init` gives any contributor a complete setup in seconds |
| Configs diverge across AI tools | Cross-platform parity — Claude, Cursor, and Codex stay consistent |
| No idea if your config is actually helping | Score your setup (A–F grade) and see exactly what to improve |
| AI keeps making the same mistakes | Session learning captures patterns and corrections automatically |

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
caliber init
│
├─ 1. 🔌 Setup        Choose your LLM provider — Claude Code seat, Cursor seat,
│                      or an API key (Anthropic, OpenAI, Vertex AI)
│
├─ 2. 🛠️  Engine       Fingerprint your project, generate configs in parallel,
│                      search community skills, and auto-refine against
│                      deterministic scoring checks (up to 2 iterations)
│
├─ 3. 👀 Review       See a diff of every proposed change — accept, refine
│                      via chat, or decline. All originals are backed up
│
└─ 4. ✅ Finalize     Write files, install auto-refresh hooks, and set up
                       session learning for continuous improvement
```

Already have a setup? If your existing config scores **95+**, Caliber skips full regeneration and applies targeted fixes to the specific checks that are failing.

### 📦 What It Generates

**Claude Code**
- `CLAUDE.md` — Project context, build/test commands, architecture, conventions
- `CALIBER_LEARNINGS.md` — Patterns learned from your AI coding sessions
- `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` — Reusable skills ([OpenSkills](https://agentskills.io) format)
- `.mcp.json` — Auto-discovered MCP server configurations
- `.claude/settings.json` — Permissions and hooks

**Cursor**
- `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` — Modern rules with frontmatter (description, globs, alwaysApply)
- `.cursor/skills/*/SKILL.md` — Skills for Cursor
- `.cursor/mcp.json` — MCP server configurations

**OpenAI Codex**
- `AGENTS.md` — Project context for Codex
- `.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` — Skills for Codex

If these files already exist, Caliber audits them and suggests improvements — keeping what works, fixing what's stale, adding what's missing.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🌍 Any Codebase
TypeScript, Python, Go, Rust, Java, Ruby, Terraform, and more. Language and framework detection is fully LLM-driven — no hardcoded mappings. Caliber works on any project.

### 🔀 Any AI Tool
Target a single platform or all three at once:
```bash
caliber init --agent claude        # Claude Code only
caliber init --agent cursor        # Cursor only
caliber init --agent codex         # Codex only
caliber init --agent all           # All three
caliber init --agent claude,cursor # Comma-separated
```

### 💬 Chat-Based Refinement
Not happy with the generated output? During review, refine via natural language — describe what you want changed and Caliber iterates until you're satisfied.

### 🔗 MCP Server Discovery
Caliber detects the tools your project uses (databases, APIs, services) and auto-configures matching MCP servers for Claude Code and Cursor.

### 📊 Deterministic Scoring
`caliber score` evaluates your config quality without any LLM calls — purely by cross-referencing config files against your actual project filesystem.

```
  Agent Config Score    88 / 100    Grade A

  FILES & SETUP                                17 / 17
  QUALITY                                      21 / 23
  GROUNDING                                    20 / 20
  ACCURACY                                     10 / 15
  FRESHNESS & SAFETY                           10 / 10
  BONUS                                         5 / 5
```

<details>
<summary>Scoring breakdown</summary>

| Category | Points | What it checks |
|---|---|---|
| **Files & Setup** | 25 | Config files exist, skills present, MCP servers, cross-platform parity |
| **Quality** | 25 | Code blocks, concise token budget, concrete instructions, structured headings |
| **Grounding** | 20 | Config references actual project directories and files |
| **Accuracy** | 15 | Referenced paths exist on disk, config freshness vs. git history |
| **Freshness & Safety** | 10 | Recently updated, no leaked secrets, permissions configured |
| **Bonus** | 5 | Auto-refresh hooks, AGENTS.md, OpenSkills format |

Every failing check includes structured fix data — when `caliber init` runs, the LLM receives exactly what's wrong and how to fix it.

</details>

### 🧠 Session Learning
Caliber watches your AI coding sessions and learns from them. Hooks capture tool usage, failures, and your corrections — then an LLM distills operational patterns into `CALIBER_LEARNINGS.md`.

```bash
caliber learn install      # Install hooks for Claude Code and Cursor
caliber learn status       # View hook status, event count, and ROI summary
caliber learn finalize     # Manually trigger analysis (auto-runs on session end)
caliber learn remove       # Remove hooks
```

Learned items are categorized by type — **[correction]**, **[gotcha]**, **[fix]**, **[pattern]**, **[env]**, **[convention]** — and automatically deduplicated. ROI tracking shows how much time and tokens the learnings save across sessions.

### 🔄 Auto-Refresh
Keep configs in sync with your codebase automatically:

| Hook | Trigger | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **Git pre-commit** | Before each commit | Refreshes docs and stages updated files |
| **Claude Code session end** | End of each session | Runs `caliber refresh` and updates docs |
| **Learning hooks** | During each session | Captures events for session learning |

```bash
caliber hooks --install    # Enable refresh hooks
caliber hooks --remove     # Disable refresh hooks
caliber learn install      # Enable learning hooks
```

The `refresh` command analyzes your git diff (committed, staged, and unstaged changes) and updates config files to reflect what changed. Works across multiple repos when run from a parent directory.

### 🛡️ Fully Reversible
Every change Caliber makes can be undone:
- **Automatic backups** — originals saved to `.caliber/backups/` before every write
- **Score regression guard** — if a regeneration produces a lower score, changes are auto-reverted
- **Full undo** — `caliber undo` restores everything to its previous state
- **Dry run** — preview changes with `--dry-run` before applying

## 📋 Commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `caliber init` | Full setup wizard — analyze, generate, review, install hooks |
| `caliber score` | Score config quality (deterministic, no LLM) |
| `caliber regenerate` | Re-analyze and regenerate configs (aliases: `regen`, `re`) |
| `caliber refresh` | Update docs based on recent code changes |
| `caliber skills` | Discover and install community skills |
| `caliber learn` | Session learning — install hooks, view status, finalize analysis |
| `caliber hooks` | Manage auto-refresh hooks |
| `caliber config` | Configure LLM provider, API key, and model |
| `caliber status` | Show current setup status |
| `caliber undo` | Revert all changes made by Caliber |

## 🔌 LLM Providers

No API key? No problem. Caliber works with your existing AI tool subscription:

| Provider | Setup | Default Model |
|---|---|---|
| **Claude Code** (your seat) | `caliber config` → Claude Code | Inherited from Claude Code |
| **Cursor** (your seat) | `caliber config` → Cursor | Inherited from Cursor |
| **Anthropic** | `export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| **OpenAI** | `export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...` | `gpt-4.1` |
| **Vertex AI** | `export VERTEX_PROJECT_ID=my-project` | `claude-sonnet-4-6` |
| **Custom endpoint** | `OPENAI_API_KEY` + `OPENAI_BASE_URL` | `gpt-4.1` |

Override the model for any provider: `export CALIBER_MODEL=<model-name>` or use `caliber config`.

Caliber uses a **two-tier model system** — lightweight tasks (classification, scoring) auto-use a faster model, while heavy tasks (generation, refinement) use the default. This keeps costs low and speed high.

Configuration is stored in `~/.caliber/config.json` with restricted permissions (`0600`). API keys are never written to project files.
